# Write a Python function that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of colors as input and returns the colors in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Constraint: All the colors will be completely in either lower case or upper case.
# Sample Input 1: green-red-yellow-black-white
# Sample Output 1: black-green-red-white-yellow
# Sample Input 2: PINK-BLUE-TAN-PURPLE
# Sample Output 2: BLUE-PINK-PURPLE-TAN

def sort_colors(colors):
    colors = colors.split("-")
    colors.sort()
    return "-".join(colors)

#take user input
colors = input("Enter colors separated by hyphen: ")
print(sort_colors(colors))
