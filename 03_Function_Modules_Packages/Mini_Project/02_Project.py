# Create a Python module with the following functions:
'''1. ispalindrome(name)  - Task--Given the user name as input, this function should tell us whether the name is a palindrome or not.
   2. count_the_vowels(name) -- Given the user name as input, this function should tell us how many vowels are present in it.
   3. frequency_of_letters(name) -- Given the user name as input, this function should tell us how many times each letter appears in the name.
Note: name will be completely in either lower case or upper case.
Import the module in another python script and test the functions by passing appropriate input.
Sample Input 1: bob
Sample Output 1:

Yes it is a palindrome.
No of vowels: 1
Frequency of letters: b-2, o-1

Sample Input 2: marcel bentok tanaka
Sample Output 2: No it is not a palindrome.
